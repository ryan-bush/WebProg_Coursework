## Key Features

#### Upload JSON survey

Surveys can be created by uploading a JSON file in the format provided in 
example-questionnaire.json. You can do so by either uploading it to the server
directly, or by copying and pasting the JSON into a text box. You are then asked to 
provide a password to secure your survey, while being shown what your survey will look
like once created. Once submitted you are given a share link.

#### Create Survey through GUI

You can also create a survey by using a GUI. You can add the four different
types of questions in the order you need them, and add a unique id and question.
Again you are asked to provide a password to secure your survey before submitting it.

#### View a list of all surveys

You can view a list of all surveys currently on the system. You can directly
view each survey, and the results page by clicking on the link. A padlock which is
either open or locked shows the open and closed surveys.

#### Submit Responses

You can submit responses to a survey by visiting the survey page, either by
navigating straight to the link or by using the survey list. You can only
submit responses to surveys which are open.

#### View responses of survey

You can view all the responses for a survey by visiting the results page for
the survey, or by using the link in the surveys list.

#### View charts of survey

While on the results page you can also view the results for each question 
in a number of different charts. Click the buttons for each type to toggle
between charts.

#### Downloads responses as JSON

On the results page you can also download all the responses as a single JSON.

#### Manage Surveys

You can manage a survey from the results page by entering the survey password. Once entered
you can open and close the survey as you wish, or delete the survey altogether.
